# Stepped Project

The project described in the _Final Project_ folder is the result of a series of challenges, or steps, each meant to introduce or reinforce a concept of SVG syntax.

In this folder you find the stepped solution progressively building the solar system.

Each sub-folder is structured with an `index.html` and `README.md` file. The former describes the code accumulated after each challenge. The latter gives a brief overview of the code introduced in the markup.

A stylesheet is included at the root level of this folder, and is shared by each and every `index.html` file.

## Project Structure

Here you find a short list of the sub-folders, including their label and purpose.
