# Stepped Project

The project described in the _Final Project_ folder is the result of a series of challenges, or steps, each meant to introduce or reinforce a concept of SVG syntax.

In this folder you find the stepped solution progressively building the solar system.

Each sub-folder is structured with an `index.html` and `README.md` file. The former describes the code accumulated after each challenge. The latter gives a brief overview of the code introduced in the markup.

Please note: each sub-folder also contains a stylesheet in `style.css`. As the project is being finalized, it is actually better to have a single stylesheet referenced by every markup file. While developing the project, and to have immediate control on the changing markup, I decided to accept the duplication of the property value pairs.

## Project Structure

Here you find a short list of the sub-folders, including their label and purpose.

1. Add an `<svg>` element.

1. Size the `<svg>` element.
