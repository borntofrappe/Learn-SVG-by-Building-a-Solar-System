# Learn SVG by Building a Solar System

## Goal

Introduce campers @freecodecamp to SVG syntax.

## Data

The project relies on accurate information regarding the size of the planets and their distance from our central star, the sun. Data is collected from [this helpful factsheet @NASA](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/planet_table_ratio.html) and organized in the following tables.

### Radius

Each planet is measured relative to the radius of planet Earth. `1` being `6,371 km`.

|Celestial Body|Radius|
|---|---|
|Sun|109|
|Mercury|0.383|
|Venus|0.949|
|Earth|1|
|Mars|0.532|
|Jupiter|11.21|
|Saturn|9.45|
|Uranus|4.01|
|Neptune|3.88|

### Distance from the sun

The measure considers astronomical units, which represent the average distance of the Earth from the Sun. `1` being `1.496e+8` (149 million, 598 thousands kilometers).

|Celestial Body|Distance from the Sun|
|---|---|
|Mercury|0.387|
|Venus|0.723|
|Earth|1|
|Mars|1.52|
|Jupiter|5.20|
|Saturn|9.58|
|Uranus|19.20|
|Neptune|30.05|

## Repo Structure

In the _complete-project_ folder you find a general idea of how the solar system will look like. An up-to-date demo is also [live @codepen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/gJpKxx). In separate folders, you then find stepped solutions leading up to the final version. The goal of each step is introducing a feature of SVG syntax, or reinforcing an SVG concept.
