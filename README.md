# Learn SVG by Building a Solar System

## Goal

Introduce campers @freecodecamp to SVG syntax.

## Project Structure

- in the **Final Project** folder you find the `index.html` and `style.css` files ultimately describing the finished project. A live demo will also be provided on CodePen.

- in the **Stepped Project** folder you find multiple sub-folders describing the steps leading up to the finished project. Following freeCodeCamp's guidelines, each step describes one concept and one concept only. To ease the organization of the project, the folders are also labeled in increments, and specify the task in their title (something akin to `01-add-svg-element`, `02-size-svg-element`).

## Data

The project relies on accurate information regarding the size of the planets in our solar system, as well as their distance from our central star, the sun. Data is drawn from [this helpful factsheet @NASA](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/planet_table_ratio.html) and organized in the following tables.

### Radius

Each planet is measured relative to the radius of planet Earth. `1` being `6,371 km`.

|Celestial Body|Radius|
|---|---|
|Sun|109|
|Mercury|0.383|
|Venus|0.949|
|Earth|1|
|Mars|0.532|
|Jupiter|11.21|
|Saturn|9.45|
|Uranus|4.01|
|Neptune|3.88|

### Distance from the sun

Each planet is measured relative to the distance between planet Earth and the sun. `1` being an astronomical unit, or otherwise `1.496e+8 km` (149 million, 598 thousands kilometers).

|Celestial Body|Distance from the Sun|
|---|---|
|Mercury|0.387|
|Venus|0.723|
|Earth|1|
|Mars|1.52|
|Jupiter|5.20|
|Saturn|9.58|
|Uranus|19.20|
|Neptune|30.05|
