# [Final Project](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/gJpKxx)

> Complete project for the freeCodeCamp project **Learn SVG by Building a Solar System**

**Be warned**: the project is still being developed and might be subject to change.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` houses the final version of the project;

- `rocket.html` describes the SVG syntax for the rocket. It is developed independently of the main markup file, but ultimately merged in `index.html`;

- `style.css` details a few `property: value` pairs meant to scale and position the `<svg>` element.
