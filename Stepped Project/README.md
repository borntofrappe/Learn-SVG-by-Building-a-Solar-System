# Stepped Project

The project described in the _Final Project_ folder is the result of a series of challenges, or steps, each meant to introduce or reinforce a concept of SVG syntax.

In this folder you find the stepped solution progressively building the solar system.

Each sub-folder is structured with an `index.html` and `README.md` file. The former describes the code accumulated after each challenge. The latter gives a brief overview of the code introduced in the markup.

`style.css` is included at the root level of this folder, but it is still unclear what is the best way to incorporate its logic. Specifically at the beginning of the project, it might be best to have no stylesheet at all.

## Project Structure

Here you find a short list of the sub-folders, including their label and purpose.

1. Add an `<svg>` element.
